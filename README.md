## mParticle Web Integration

A web integration (or a kit) is an extension to the core [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-javascript-sdk). It works as a bridge between the mParticle SDK and a CleverTap SDK. It abstracts the implementation complexity, simplifying the implementation for developers.

A kit takes care of initializing and forwarding information depending on what you've configured in [mParticle's dashboard](https://app.mparticle.com).
